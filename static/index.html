                    <p>secureblue offers hardened operaring system images generated with <a href="https://blue-build.org/">BlueBuild</a>, using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/">Fedora Atomic Desktop</a>'s <a href="https://pagure.io/workstation-ostree-config">base images</a> as a starting point for desktop images and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/">Fedora CoreOS</a> for <code>securecore</code> server images. The project also maintains hardened-chromium, a hardened fork inspired by GrapheneOS's Vanadiumm that uses Fedora's Chromium as a base, intended for use with hardened_malloc as packaged and provided in secureblue desktop images.</p>

                    <p>The project applies hardening with the following goals in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase defenses against the exploitation of both known and unknown vulnerabilities;</li>
                        <li>Avoid sacrificing usability for most use cases where possible;</li>
                        <li>Avoid sacrificing tangible security for "privacy", as that's often a euphemism for security theater.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>For hardened-chromium, these goals are extended to include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Desktop-relevant patches from Vanadium (located in vanadium_patches);</li>
                        <li>Changes that make secondary browser features opt-in instead of opt-out (for example, making the password manager and search suggestions opt-in);</li>
                        <li>Changes that disable opt-in metrics and data collection, so long as they have no security implications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We wholly <em>avoid</em> the following, out of scope topics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any novel functionality that is unrelated to security.</li>
                        <li>Anything related to "degoogling" chromium. For example, we will not be replacing hardened-chromium with Brave or ungoogled-chromium. Both of them make changes that sacrifice security for "privacy", such as enabling MV2;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2><a href="#rationale">Rationale</a></h2>

                    <p>Fedora is one of the few distributions that ships with selinux and associated tooling built-in and enabled by default, aside from being sufficiently private. This makes it advantageous as a starting point for building a hardened system. However, out of the box it's lacking hardening in numerous other areas. This project's goal is to improve on that significantly.</p>

                    <h2><a href="#customization">Customization</a></h2>

                    <p>If you want to add your own customizations on top of secureblue, you are advised strongly against forking. Instead, create a repo for your own image by using the <a href="https://github.com/blue-build/template">BlueBuild template</a>, then change your base-image to a secureblue image. This will allow you to apply your customizations to secureblue in a concise and maintainable way, without the need to constantly sync with upstream.</p>
